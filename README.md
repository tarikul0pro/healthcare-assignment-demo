# About my website:
1.The power of community to create health is far greater than any physician, clinic or hospital.
2.While weight loss is important, what's more important is the quality of food you put in your body - food is information that quickly changes your metabolism and genes.
3.Instead of going out to dinner, buy good food. Cooking at home shows such affection. In a bad economy, it's more important to make yourself feel good.
4.Hospital life--with its byzantine array of moving parts layered atop the unpredictable rhythms of illness is a permanent state of flux.
5.Getting out of the hospital is a lot like resigning from a book club. You're not out of it until the computer says you're out of it.
